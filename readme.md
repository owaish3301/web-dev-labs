# Web Dev Labs ðŸ§ª

A collection of small learning projects and experiments in web development. These are bite-sized apps to practice frontend frameworks, state management, and simple backend APIs.

## Projects Overview
 
This workspace contains three example projects included for reference and practice:

- **`01-counter-practiseStateManagement`** â€” A small React + Vite app demonstrating state management with Jotai and Redux in two different branches.
- **`02-auth-practise`** â€” A small full-stack demo for authentication with JWT.
- **`03-bankApp`** â€” A full-stack demo with a Node/Express backend (`03-bankApp/backend`) and a Vite React frontend (`03-bankApp/frontend`). Shows authentication, transaction routes, and client pages for sign-in/sign-up.

## How to Run (Windows PowerShell)

Each mini project has its own README file with instructions to set it up locally. Follow the steps in the respective README files to run the projects.
